If you opt to make monthly payments, you can take advantage of a 7-day free trial to experience learning with Coursera Plus before you decide to purchase. We do capture your payment information when you subscribe, but you won't be charged until the end of your 7-day free trial. So, if you decide Coursera Plus isn't right for you, just cancel during the trial period and there will be no charge. If you opt to make an annual payment, you'll have up to 14 days to submit a refund request if you decide that Coursera Plus isn't right for you. The process is simple—just go to your My Purchases page within 14 days of your payment and submit a refund request. No additional information is required. Please note that any certificates that you earn within your first 14 days will be revoked if you decide to get a refund within that period. For additional information, please see our full refund policy."
